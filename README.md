 This project includes a sample metropolitan area network simulation which designed with Cisco Packet Tracer.                      
Features:
Metropolitan area network design includes two distinct branches office in a city, which are connected by routers (at least two routers for each branch) over an ISP (Internet Service Provider). You also should consider connection technologies between ISP and branches.
2. First branchâ€™s network is comprised of 3 distinct facilities and each facility has different units and requirements. All specification for the first branch office is as following:
a. First facility has 5 workstation (PC) users, 5 wireless users (laptop) and 5 smartphone users. These users browse web, send emails and transfer files by using their devices.
b. Second facility has 10 workstation users who use Web and FTP. 5 of workstations are used for VoIP conference events.
c. Third facility has a server farm including 3 Web servers, 2 FTP servers, 1 DHCP server, 1 mail server and 1 domain name server (DNS).
3. Second branch includes 3 distinct facilities and each facility includes different units and requirements.
a. First facility has 5 workstation users, 10 wireless users and 5 tablet users who connect to the Internet using wireless connection, browse Web and use email applications.
b. Second facility has 10 workstation users and 5 smartphone users. They use web browsing, editing applications and transfer files.
